# AI-Powered Toy Car with BCI Control  

## Overview  
This project features an AI-powered toy car capable of autonomous navigation, traffic sign recognition, and obstacle avoidance. The car’s acceleration is controlled using a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), allowing users to interact with it through neural signals.

## Features  
- **Autonomous Navigation**: AI-based pathfinding and decision-making.  
- **Traffic Sign Recognition**: The car responds to signs like "Stop" and "Speed Limit."  
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Detects and avoids obstacles in real-time.  
- **BCI-Controlled Acceleration**: Control the car’s speed using your brain signals.

## Technologies  
- **Hardware**: Microcontroller (Arduino/Raspberry Pi), ultrasonic sensors, BCI headset (OpenBCI), camera module.  
- **Software**: TensorFlow, OpenCV, Python, Arduino IDE, BCI signal processing libraries.  
- **AI Models**: CNN for traffic sign detection, Reinforcement Learning for navigation.
